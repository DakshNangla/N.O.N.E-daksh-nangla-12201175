# N.O.N.E-daksh-nangla-12201175

Project Overview 

N.O.N.E. is an autonomous, multi-agent research assistant designed to generate real-time, fact-checked reports on complex topics. It clones the idea of an intelligent assistant (like Jarvis) but elevates it with a self-correcting Critic Agent to ensure high-quality, hallucination-free output.


Problem Statement 

Knowledge workers and analysts face difficulty quickly synthesizing timely, reliable information from the web. Current single-LLM summarizers are prone to "hallucinations" (generating factually incorrect information), requiring extensive manual verification. 


Solution Summary 

We built a multi-agent system, N.O.N.E., using the CrewAI framework, orchestrated via a Python/FastAPI backend. The system coordinates four specialized AI Agents to execute a research task, with a mandatory internal review by the Critic Agent before the final report is generated. This structure drastically improves factual accuracy and speed. 



Technical Depth & LLM Choices 




N.O.N.E. is a robust AI-driven solution demonstrating strong technical depth in agent orchestration and modern web services.
